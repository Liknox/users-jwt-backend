###### In order to use this app, you have to write ```npm i``` (installation all required packages) and then write npm start.
###### First of all If you wanna use this app, you have to register. You must send ```POST``` request to http://localhost:5000/auth/registration with special data in JSON format with username and password. This data should pass validation check. After this you will get success response from the server.
###### When your account was created you must login in this account. You have to sen ```POST``` request to http://localhost:5000/auth/login. And if you did everything right, you will get special token. Finally, with this token you're able to get information about all registered users (if you're signed up as admin). That's probably all what I wanna say about this app.
